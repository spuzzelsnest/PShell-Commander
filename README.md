 # pShell-Commander                

Built and restructured from an old batch program I once wrote, AD-Aid, a tool for Active Directory information gathering. Writen in PowerShell this time and build on a set of tools like Get-ADUser and Get-ADComputer.
Expanded with network capabilities by using the Invoke-Command.

Runs from PowerShell version 3.0  and will be expanded to Unix Systems.

# Tools Available

- AD User info
- Remote PC info
- Track online status of PC's
- Remote Temp file cleaner
- Remote script file execution
- Dump customisable executable files
- Remote CMD
- Remote Registry

# How to run

## Windows

Make sure the execution policy is set in PowerShell, to check use:

```bash
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

To set the execution policy, run PowerShell as an Administrator and run this code:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force
```

After downloading the project, you can run the script from powershell.

```bash
.\psCom.ps1
```

## Using the Alive service

The Alive.ps1, located in the ./bin/ folder, is a script I wrote to generate a HTML file do display the status of a given list of ip addresses. The list of PC's should be located on the desktop, as the code refers to ```bash $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\PC-list.txt ```
The HTML file will be create in the startup folder located at ```bash "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\pc-report.html" ```

To make it work, I used [PS2EXE-GUI](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5) to convert it first to an EXE file to run it as a service with the main PShell Commander program.
