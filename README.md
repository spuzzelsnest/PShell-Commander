 # pShell-Commander                

Built and restructured from an old Batch Program I once wrote, AD-Aid, a tool for Active Directory info. Writen in PowerShell this time and build on a set of tools like Get-ADUser and Get-ADComputer.
Expanded with network capabilities by using the SysInternals Tool set like PSExec and module support like PSRemoteRegistry.

Runs from Powershell version 3.0  and will be expanded to Unix Systems.
